# Prisma Migration Documentation

## Overview

The Reference Data Management (RRDM) application has been migrated from using Sequelize with JSON files to Prisma with a Neon PostgreSQL database. This migration was performed to ensure compatibility with Vercel's serverless environment and to improve the application's performance and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Database Layer

- **Removed Sequelize**: All Sequelize models, configurations, and dependencies have been removed.
- **Added Prisma**: Implemented Prisma ORM with a schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Database**: Migrated from JSON files to a Neon PostgreSQL database.

### Services Layer

- **Created Service Modules**: Implemented service modules for each domain entity (BCR, Funding, etc.) to handle database operations.
- **Centralized Business Logic**: Moved business logic from routes to services for better separation of concerns.

### Routes Layer

- **Updated Route Handlers**: Modified route handlers to use the new Prisma-based service modules.
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Improved error handling with more consistent patterns.

## Prisma Schema

The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) defines the following models:

- `Bcr`: Business Change Requests
- `BcrConfig`: Configuration for BCRs
- `FundingRequirement`: Funding requirements
- `FundingHistory`: Funding history entries
- `ReferenceData`: Reference data items
- `ReleaseNote`: Release notes
- `User`: User accounts
- `Session`: Session storage for authentication

## Services

The following service modules have been implemented:

- `bcrService.js`: Handles BCR operations
- `bcrConfigService.js`: Manages BCR configuration
- `fundingService.js`: Manages funding requirements and history
- `referenceDataService.js`: Handles reference data operations
- `userService.js`: Manages user accounts

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the Prisma-based implementation:

- Mock Prisma client in tests instead of Sequelize models
- Updated assertions to match the new data structure
- Skipped outdated tests that were still using the file-based approach

## Deployment

The application is now fully compatible with Vercel's serverless environment:

- Uses Prisma's connection pooling for efficient database connections
- Implements proper connection handling for serverless functions
- Configures session storage using Prisma Session Store

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize database queries for performance
- Implement more comprehensive error handling
- Add more unit and integration tests
- Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data
