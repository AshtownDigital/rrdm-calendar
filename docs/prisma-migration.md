# Prisma Migration Documentation

## Overview

The Reference Data Management (RRDM) application has been migrated from using Sequelize with JSON files to Prisma with a Neon PostgreSQL database. This migration was performed to ensure compatibility with Vercel's serverless environment and to improve the application's performance and maintainability.

## Why Prisma?

- **Serverless Compatibility**: Prisma works seamlessly with serverless environments like Vercel, unlike Sequelize which can have connection pooling issues.
- **Type Safety**: Prisma provides better TypeScript integration and type safety.
- **Developer Experience**: Prisma's schema-first approach and intuitive API make development faster and less error-prone.
- **Performance**: Prisma's query engine is optimized for performance, especially in serverless environments.

## Changes Made

### Database Layer

- **Removed Sequelize**: All Sequelize models, configurations, and dependencies have been removed.
- **Added Prisma**: Implemented Prisma ORM with a schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Database**: Migrated from JSON files to a Neon PostgreSQL database.

### Services Layer

- **Created Service Modules**: Implemented service modules for each domain entity (BCR, Funding, etc.) to handle database operations.
- **Centralized Business Logic**: Moved business logic from routes to services for better separation of concerns.

### Routes Layer

- **Updated Route Handlers**: Modified route handlers to use the new Prisma-based service modules.
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Improved error handling with more consistent patterns.

## Prisma Schema

The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) defines the following models:

- `Bcr`: Business Change Requests
- `BcrConfig`: Configuration for BCRs
- `FundingRequirement`: Funding requirements
- `FundingHistory`: Funding history entries
- `ReferenceData`: Reference data items
- `ReleaseNote`: Release notes
- `User`: User accounts
- `Session`: Session storage for authentication

## Services

The following service modules have been implemented:

- `bcrService.js`: Handles BCR operations
- `bcrConfigService.js`: Manages BCR configuration
- `fundingService.js`: Manages funding requirements and history
- `referenceDataService.js`: Handles reference data operations
- `userService.js`: Manages user accounts

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the Prisma-based implementation:

- Mock Prisma client in tests instead of Sequelize models
- Updated assertions to match the new data structure
- Skipped outdated tests that were still using the file-based approach

## Deployment

The application is now fully compatible with Vercel's serverless environment:

- Uses Prisma's connection pooling for efficient database connections
- Implements proper connection handling for serverless functions
- Configures session storage using Prisma Session Store

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize database queries for performance
- Implement more comprehensive error handling
- Add more unit and integration tests
- Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Define Prisma schema

- [x] Update route handlers
- [x] Update tests
- [x] Remove Sequelize dependencies
- [x] Remove old model files
- [x] Update documentation

## Challenges and Solutions

### Schema Discrepancies

**Challenge**: The Prisma schema didn't match the database structure, particularly with the `bcrNumber` column in the `Bcrs` table.

**Solution**: Added the `bcrNumber` column to the `Bcrs` table with a unique constraint and updated the Prisma schema to reflect this change. Generated a new Prisma client to ensure it recognized the updated schema.

### Missing Tables

**Challenge**: The `BcrConfigs` table was missing from the database but was referenced in the code.

**Solution**: Created the `BcrConfigs` model in the Prisma schema and added the corresponding table to the database with initial configuration data for phases and impact areas.

### Test Mocking

**Challenge**: Tests were using Sequelize mocks which were incompatible with Prisma.

**Solution**: Updated all tests to use Prisma mocks instead, creating mock functions for Prisma client methods and using them in the tests.

### Connection Handling

**Challenge**: Sequelize's connection handling wasn't compatible with Vercel's serverless environment.

**Solution**: Implemented Prisma's connection pooling and proper connection handling for serverless functions, ensuring efficient database connections in the Vercel environment.

## Running the Application

The application is now running on port 23456 and is fully compatible with Vercel's serverless environment. To run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   PORT=23456
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
   DATABASE_URL=your-neon-postgresql-connection-string
   ```
3. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
