# MongoDB Migration Plan for RRDM

This document outlines the step-by-step process to migrate the RRDM application from PostgreSQL (Prisma) to MongoDB.

## 1. Database Schema Migration

### 1.1 Analyze Current Prisma Schema

First, we need to analyze the current Prisma schema to understand the data models and relationships.

```bash
# Extract Prisma schema information
npx prisma db pull
```

### 1.2 Design MongoDB Schema

Based on the Prisma schema, we'll design equivalent MongoDB schemas:

- Convert tables to collections
- Transform relationships to embedded documents or references
- Adapt data types to MongoDB equivalents

### 1.3 Create MongoDB Models

Create Mongoose models for each entity in the application.

## 2. Data Migration

### 2.1 Export Data from PostgreSQL

```bash
# Export data to JSON format
node scripts/export-postgres-data.js
```

### 2.2 Transform Data

Transform the exported data to match the MongoDB schema structure.

### 2.3 Import Data to MongoDB

```bash
# Import transformed data to MongoDB
node scripts/import-to-mongodb.js
```

## 3. Code Refactoring

### 3.1 Replace Prisma Queries

Replace all Prisma queries with equivalent MongoDB/Mongoose queries:

- Find operations
- Create operations
- Update operations
- Delete operations
- Relationship handling

### 3.2 Update Controllers and Services

Modify all controllers and services to use MongoDB instead of Prisma.

### 3.3 Update API Routes

Ensure all API routes work with the new MongoDB backend.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Unit Testing

Test all MongoDB models and queries.

### 4.2 Integration Testing

Test the integration between different components.

### 4.3 End-to-End Testing

Test complete user flows to ensure functionality is preserved.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Update Environment Variables

Update all environment variables for MongoDB in development and production.

### 5.2 Update Vercel Configuration

Modify Vercel configuration to support MongoDB.

### 5.3 Deploy and Monitor

Deploy the migrated application and monitor for any issues.

## 6. Cleanup

### 6.1 Remove Prisma Dependencies

Remove Prisma-related code and dependencies.

### 6.2 Documentation Update

Update all documentation to reflect the MongoDB architecture.

## Timeline

- Schema Analysis and Design: 1-2 days
