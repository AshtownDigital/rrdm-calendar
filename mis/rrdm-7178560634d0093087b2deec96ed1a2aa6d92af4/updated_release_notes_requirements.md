## 2. Academic Year Navigation

### Purpose
To provide users with an intuitive interface for navigating between different academic years within the Release Notes module, allowing them to view reference data changes specific to their selected academic year.

### Description
The Academic Year Navigation feature implements a tab-based interface that allows users to switch between different academic years (e.g., 2023/24, 2024/25, 2025/26) when viewing release notes. The system will maintain the selected year context across different views and update the URL accordingly to support direct linking and bookmarking.
